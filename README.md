## Development

After cloning this repo, make sure you run `npm install` in the Javascript folder, and then `carthage update --platform iOS` in the source folder.

XCode's Build should take care of all the build steps (including the Webpack Bundler). If you run into any issues building the app - get in touch with Kapilan.
